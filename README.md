# About the Project

I served as a Data Management and Integration Intern at Listen to Our Future (LTOF), a nonprofit organization that connects high school and college students to tutor younger students in the Indianapolis area. Their mission is to close the educational gaps that were exacerbated by COVID-19 and help students reach their full potential. As an intern, I analyzed the organizationâ€™s data collection techniques, evaluated their data storage methods, and identified areas for improvement. My role involved streamlining data management processes, integrating datasets, and ensuring that the collected information could be effectively used to track program impact and student progress. I am currently combining data to make a dashboard that can be used as evidence in grant proposals, to evaluate performance and more.
